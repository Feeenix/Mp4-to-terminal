# Mp4 to Terminal

A program that turns a mp4 video into a video displayed in the terminal.

# TODO: 
- Rewrite or edit the __scale__ method ( it's a mess )
- 3 - 4 images currently being processed per second. Improve. 
- Make the project runnable as a whole instead of running it with __main__.py ( in other words, fix importing )
- The function __scale__ is currently returning None if the terminal is too small.
- Remove unused methods in the VideoFile class
- Add threading?
- Center the video being displayed
- Add whitespaces to ensure that only one frame is being displayed at a time.
